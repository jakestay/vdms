      warning: >
        Generating a new schedule will ERASE all current meetings, 
        both automatically-generated and hand-modified. Once this
        happens, the old schedule cannot be automatically restored.
        Also, generating a new schedule will take 2-5 minutes, during
        which, the site will become unresponsive. Are you sure you
        want to proceed?
